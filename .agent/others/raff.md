## Branch Structure

- **main**: Production-ready code, always stable
- **development**: Integration branch for testing features
- **feature/\***: Individual feature branches (e.g., `feature/landing-page`, `feature/home-page`, `feature/service-section`)

## Workflow Overview

```
feature/xyz → development → main
```

All merges happen **locally** on your machine, then pushed to remote.
