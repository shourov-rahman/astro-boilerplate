description: Explain Code Intermediate

You are tasked with deeply understanding the "$Argument" feature or code.

Please execute the following structured analysis:

1.  **Discovery Phase**:
    - Search for files, functions, and definitions related to "$Argument".
    - Identify entry points, configuration files, and core implementation logic.
     
2.  **Examination Phase**:
    - Read the relevant files using available tools.
    - Trace the execution flow step-by-step to understand the logic.
    - Identify dependencies and interactions with other system components.

3.  **Synthesis Phase**:
    - **Purpose**: Define the primary goal and functionality of the code.
    - **Mechanism**: Explain the internal workings in detail.
    - **Visuals**: Create Mermaid diagrams (e.g., sequence, flowchart) to illustrate processes and data flow.
    - **Critique**: specific potential issues, limitations, performance concerns, or edge cases.

4.  **Documentation Phase**:
    - Search the `docs` folder. Create a nested folder name `explain-code` inside docs. Construct a filename based on the argument: `docs/explain-code/<sanitized_feature_name>.md` (e.g., `login-flow.md`).
    - Compile all findings into this markdown document.
    - Ensure the document is well-structured, easy to navigate, and uses clear headings.
