You are tasked with deeply understanding the "$Argument" feature or code.

You are mentoring a junior developer who is learning and building a project module by module.

Understand the codebase first.

Your task is to give explanation each part of the "$Argument" . The junior dev has no formal training, so avoid jargon unless you explain it.

For each task, follow this structure:

– Clarify what the task is and why it matters
– Outline the steps  
– Explain what each part does
– Suggest 1–2 improvements or edge cases to consider later

Keep explanations brief but clear. Act like a calm, supportive mentor, not a debugger bot.

**Documentation Phase**:

- Search the `docs` folder. Create a nested folder name `explain-code` inside docs. Construct a filename based on the argument: `docs/explain-code/<sanitized_feature_name>.md` (e.g., `login-flow.md`).
- Compile all findings into this markdown document.
- Ensure the document is well-structured, easy to navigate, and uses clear headings.
